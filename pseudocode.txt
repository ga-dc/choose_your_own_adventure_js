Congratulations!  You've been beamed into a Hardy Boys mystery.  Choose a character.
  -Frank
  -Joe
      Class at Bayport High has just let out and you receive an urgent message from your dad.  A rare moonstone  shipped on a freighter just arriving from India has disappeared.  Where do you want to go?
        -Home (to meet with your father)
            You catch sight of a suspicious character eavesdropping in the bushes.  What do you do?
              -Chase
                  The man sees you and gets away!  You return home, where your dad gives you the details of the theft.  It is a complex smuggling operation, and because all the trails are cold, there is no clear next step.  Shucks!
              -Ignore him and plant false information when you meet with dad.
                  Great thinking, sleuth!  Dad outlines a false plan to arrange a meeting with the ship's crew.  The police close in on the warehouse and intercept the theif on his way in.  The moonstone is recovered!  How do you want to celebrate?
                    -Beach Boys dance party at Callie's house.  Wohoo!
                    -Call Chet, Tony, Biff, Callie, and Iola and meet up at the Silver Diner.  Burgers and shakes!

        -Police Station (to meet with Chief Collig)
            You catch sight of a suspicious character sitting in a parked car in front of the station.  When you see him, he drives away.  What do you do?
              -Head into the station and report
                  Chief Collig issues a warning over the radio and informs the police down at the wharf.  The driver arrives at the wharf and is arrested, but he doesn't have the moonstone.  Darn!
              -Hop on your motorcycles and pursue
                  The car drives to the warehouse next to the wharf and the driver goes inside.  What next?
                    -enter the warehouse
                      It's dark inside.  The next thing you know, you are knocked out, gagged, and tied up.  Better luck next time, gumshoe!
                    -wait for police reinforcements and then enter
                      The chief arrives with backup and they enter the warehouse.  They arrest an entire band of smugglers and recover the moonstone.  How do you want to celebrate?
                          -Beach Boys dance party at Callie's house.  Wohoo!
                          -Call Chet, Tony, Biff, Callie, and Iola and meet up at the Silver Diner.

        -The wharf to investigate the freighter
            You catch sight of a suspicious character watching you who immediately heads toward an adjacent warehouse. What do you do?
              -Chase.
                  You tackle and subdue him.  The missing gem stone is in his pocket. Nice work!  How do you want to celebrate?
                      -Beach Boys dance party at Callie's house.  Wohoo!
                      -Call Chet, Tony, Biff, Callie, and Iola and meet up at the Silver Diner.  Burgers and shakes!
              -Head to the freighter to inform the crew of suspicious activity on shore.
                  You head up the gangplank and enter the bridge.  It appears abandoned, but a split second later, the lights go out and you are subdued by several stevedores.  You are tied up and thrown into a bale of jute in the cargo area.  Better luck next time, gumshoe!
