/*
Each path of decisions is inside its own function.
An array, paths, holds variables representing those functions / paths.
play() starts the game.  It asks the user for a number. Then a for loop goes
thru paths and calls a function at the index matching the number entered by the
user.At the end of each path, the user is asked if she wants to play again.
That gets done by the playAgain() function. If user answers yes, play() starts
the game again.
