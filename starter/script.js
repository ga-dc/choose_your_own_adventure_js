// put code here!
// steal storyline from LPTHW text adventure
/*Rules

Goal Using what you know about data types, variables, operators,
conditional blocks, and accepting user input, create a text-based game that
allows the user to arrive at different "destinations" based on the inputs they
type.

Any path the user goes down must ask them at least
3 questions(more if you want!)

There must be a minimum of 7 total destinations the user could arrive at based
on their responses.(again more if you want!)
For at least 1(also can be more!) of the questions asked, there must be more
then 2 possible user responses
Adventure must contain at least one integer response and one string response
Adventure must contain at least one functional loop in the code base
hint you may need parseInt() and toString()*/
