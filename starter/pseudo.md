“Welcome to Internal Feud!! What is you name?”
Matthew

“Nice to meet you, Matthew. We are thrilled to have you on the show!”

“Ok let’s get started. We asked 100 guys to name something a wife tells her husband he needs to change. The top 6 answers in random order are: Eating Habits, His Looks, Staying Out Late, His Clothes, His Job, and His Attitude. What is the number 1 answer?”

If they choose “His Clothes”, output “Good answer! Changing “His Clothes is in fact the number 1 answer!” Then the loop ends and outputs “Thanks for playing and see you next time on Internal Feud!!”
“His Clothes"

Else if they choose “His Looks”, output “Good answer but that is the number 3 answer. Try again!”
“His Looks”

Else
