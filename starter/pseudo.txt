Prompt
You are an adventurer. You have travelled to a cave high in a mountain range.
Legend has it that there are three treasures within the cave. One treasure is guarded by a dragon.
One treasure is hidden in a so called "spider" maze. Nothing is known about the third treasure.
You have an old map which shows the location of the dragon and the start of the maze.
You don't have any information about the third treasure.
Would you like to head for the 'dragon' or the 'maze'?

if questResponse equals 'dragon', {
show dragonPrompt.

  dragonPrompt
  You enter the dragon's lair. As the dragon snores, he warms the bed upon which he lays.
  His bed is made of coals and his nostrils expell fire as he sleeps. A bag hangs from the dragons necklace.
  You notice a single gold coin on the floor which must have fallen from the bag.
  The coin is partially melted.
  A single gold coin is valuable enough to sustain your lifestyle for a year.
  If the bag contains only gold, it likely weighs more than you.
  Curious, you wonder how an ordinary bag could lay on coals and not burn.
  Would you like to 'sneak' and steal from the dragon, 'wake' and reason with it, or 'slay' it?

  if dragonPrompt response = 'sneak', {
    show sneakPrompt

    sneakPrompt
    The coals look hot, but the gold is tantalizingly hot. There must be about a thousand gold coins
    in the bag. How many would you like to steal?

    if sneakPrompt response <= 50 {
      show notGreedySneak prompt
      You hastily yet quietly hurry to the bag. Switching your weight between feet as you fiddle with the bag,
      you manage to open it and collect (sneakPrompt response) coins. You quickly get off the coals and exit
      the dragon's lair without him noticing. Your feet suffered minor burns but you have more than enough coin
      to pay for medical bills. Would you like to try for the other treasure? (y/n)

      if notGreedySneakPrompt response == y {
        show ultimatelyGreedySneakPrompt
        Unfortunately, the treasures are cursed. Any one adventurer who attempts to obtain treasure from
        both areas in the cave loses touch with reality, becomes lost in the cave and ultimately goes insane.
        You head toward the spider cave but suddenly forget where you were going and why. You only
        know that you feel a deep sense of dissatisfaction. You feel you should be searching for something, so
        you wander the maze aimlessly. Lonely and unhappy, you begin to mumble to yourself. You feel the words
        begin to lose their meaning over time until your sure you just speaking jibberish, but you continue anyway
        so you can hear your own voice to be sure you're still alive. GAME OVER. YOU LOSE.

      You have chosen to leave the cave. As you take a step toward the exit, a benevolent voice booms in your head.
      "You have chosen well, adventurer. The third treasure is granted. You will keep your sanity and your treasure.
      You will also have a heart of gold. But not in a literal sense because that would kill you. You will have the
      wisdom to do right by yourself and others. Though you have stolen, you were not greedy thus you will be able to
      have strong relationships and have a truly valuable life." GAME OVER. YOU WIN.

      You hastily yet quietly hurry to the bag. Switching your weight between feet as you fiddle with the bag,
      you manage to open it. You try to fit too many coins in your pockets. You try to carry the bag but it won't budge.
      You accidentally spilled some coins from your pocket and awoke the dragon. As the dragon rose,
      even more coins fell from the open bag. He seems pissed. You fire a well placed arrow and the bag falls from his necklace.
      The dragon is breathing in getting ready to burn you. You might have enough time to grab 10 more 'coins'
      or grab the 'bag'.

      if greedySneakPrompt response == coins {
        You managed to grab 10 more coins before the dragon exhaled. Congratualtions. He exhaled just afterward.
        Fortunately, he prefers his meals rare, so you weren't burned too badly before being eaten alive.
        GAME OVER. YOU LOSE.

      show bagPrompt{
        You realized at the last second that the fire-retardant bag can be used as armor against the dragon.
        You put the bag on, and scurry toward the exit. The dragon shoots flames at you. But you are safe.
        You step outside the dragons lair. Your bag-armor crumbles to dust. After all the confusion and spilling of coins,
        you have only 40 coins in your pocket. Would you like to try for the other treasure? (y/n)
