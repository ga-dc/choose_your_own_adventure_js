Now Playing: The Matrix Re-Reloaded! Starring:
//enter name

Well, I would've stuck with Keanu Reeves, but I'm not the director, you are!

You wake up after a late night of haxing. Suddenly you notice that someone has taken
control of your computer!

Follow the white rabbit, $name.

Then--a knock at the door! A white rabbit tattoo! Do you (f)ollow the white rabbit or
(o)rder Dominos and watch the next season of The Hills?

//  (f)
        Wow do you always go to underground raves on Tuesday nights? Pretty badass/
        irresponsible.


//  (o)
        Your intrusive friends browbeat you into submission (rightfully) and you
        go out anyway.

You're at the night club, which is playing Rob Zombie for some reason, because
who in their right mind doesn't dance to Rob Zombie? (What?!)

Someone of the opposite gender sidles up behind you.

"Hello, Neo," the person says.

"How do you know that name?" you respond.

"I know a lot about you. I've been wanting to meet you for some time."

Do you (e)ngage or (g)et away from this admitted stalker?

//  (e)
        "Who are you?" you ask.

        "My name is Trinity."

        "The Trinity? The Trinity that cracked the Kansas City Chuckie Cheese?"

        "That was a long time ago," they respond.

        "That was like two months ago!"

        "That feels right."

        A long, awkward pause drags on. "I always thought you were the opposite
        gender."

        Trinity muses on how you made an uncomfortable moment even more awkward.
        "Most people of your gender do."

        "That was you on my computer, wasn't it?"

        "Yes," they say. "I brought you here to warn you, Neo.  You are in a lot
        of danger..."

        The next day, you're late for work. Maybe don't go clubbing on Tuesdays.

        You get a package at your desk. That's odd--you didn't order anything.

        You open it and pull out a cell phone from 1998. It looks hilarious now.

        Suddenly, the phone rings! It's AT&T.

        (A)re you satisfied with your long distance coverage or would you
        like to (c)hange to AT&T?

        //  a
            You hang up. Time is money, after all.

            Suddenly the phone rings again!!!!

            "Hello," a deep and pleasing voice says.

            "Morpheus?!" you ask.

            "Wait, how on Earth did you guess that right away?"

            "I...I don't know. I answer every call that way. You know, just in case."

            "OK..." Morpheus says. "That's objectively weird. Anyway, I've been
            watching you, Neo, and I want to meet you."

            "LOL and you called me weird?"

            "LOL indeed, Neo. But you have to listen to me. There is a break room
            at the end of the row of cubicles. Inside that break room is a quilt.
            I need you to jump out the window of the break room and use the quilt
            as a parachute."

            Do you (u)se the quilt as a parachute or (t)urn yourself in to
            the agents?

            //  u

            For a fleeting moment, you feel the quilt parachute working. Then reality
            sets in and you plummet 40 stories. You definitely have guts!

            MOVIE OVER!!!

            //  t

            You're escorted from the building by a couple suits. Despite being
            apprehended for badass computer haxin, everyone you work with
            assumes it's something filthy.

*********        

        //  c
            After thirty minutes on the phone, you now have unlimited calls to
            28 countries and over 3000 foreign language cable channels. You
            are not good at saying no.

            Also, Morpheus called like 4 times but you missed every one
            talking to Chad from AT&T. So the agents picked you up. Idiot.

********

//  (g)
        "Umm, I think I left my shower light on, I have to go."

        Feeling a bit mystified, you walk home. Only now Rob Zombie is stuck
        in your head.

        The next day, you're late for work. Maybe don't go clubbing on Tuesdays.

            "LOL indeed, Neo. Did you enjoy your talk with Trinity?"

            "Who?"

            "The person from the rave last night."

            You struggle to remember. "I didn't meet anyone last night."

            A pause. "Re--really?"

            "No, I left pretty early."

            "So I guess I need to go over everything now?"

            You shrug. "I guess. What's this about?"

            You hear a sigh through the phone. "Do you have a pen or something?"

            And the agents arrived almost twenty minutes ago and have been
            standing in your cubicle waiting for you to finish. Needless to say,
            they no longer consider you a threat.

            MOVIE OVER!!!
