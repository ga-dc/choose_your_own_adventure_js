What sport would you like to get advice on?
Tennis or quidditch? (T/Q)

If tennis then
Do you play with your left or right hand? (L/R)
If Left Hand then
 Choose your strength: Forehand, backhand, serve, volley? (F,B,S,V)
Forehand- Nice! you will be hitting with topspin to pull a righty opponent off the court in no time!
Backhand- A strong lefty backhand will will you any match if you can handle the opponents forehand
Serve- Great! Be sure to mix it up as often as possible to keep your opponent guessing
Volley- Try a drop shot once in a while and aim for mid court

Choose your weakness: (F,R,S,O)
Footwork- This is essential in tennis so run and stretch a lot, and eat healthy
Return Serve- Split step right before opponent strikes the ball
Serve- Toss the ball high, stay low to the ground, and then spring up upon striking the ball
Other- Uh oh! you may need a different coach..

If Ron then "guard the loops!"
If Hermone then "go push Malfoy off his broom!"
If Malfoy then "You Suck"
