* Keith, it is January 25th 2016 you're Frank Underwood's new campaign manager.  Hilary and Bernie have him on the ropes and you need to revive his campaign.  Should President Underwood head to Iowa, New Hampshire, or Nevada? [Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada]`
  * [Iowa]
      * We have $10,000,000 budget for attack ads.  What percentage of that should be directed at Hilary Clinton? [0-100%]
        * [< 50%] Not sure if this is wise.  Hilary is leading all of the polls, we may need to up the ante.  Do you want to prod Donald Trump into attacking? [Yes/No]   
          * [Yes]
          * [No]
        * [> 50%] I like how you operate.  But Bernie is doing too well in New Hampshire.  Do you want to pay a Union leader $50k to go on strike in Vermont to take his attention off the campaign?  [Yes/No]
          * [Yes]
          * [No]
  * [New Hampshire]
    * We're polling terribly here and Bernie is crushing it.  Should we cut our losses and head to Nevada or sabotage Bernie's campaign? [Nevada/Sabotage]
      * [Sabotage]  Now you're thinking like a winner.  Should we plant coke on Bernie's campaign manager or pay a loyal supporter to claim she had an affair with him? [Coke/Affair]
        * [Coke]  Busted.  You're intern got arrested and ratted you out.  You can either take all the blame and protect the President or cop a deal and save yourself. [Take Blame/Plea deal]
          * [Take Blame]  The President's super PAC will pay your legal expenses and have a $1,000,000 in an offshore account when you get out of prison.
          * [Plea Deal]  The President's super PAC has quietly dedicated $1,000,000 to pay guards and inmates to make your life hell.
        * [Affair] Brilliant.  Secretary Clinton jumped all over the accusation and has badly bruised Sander's poll numbers while you keep distance yourself, avoid all suspicion, and continue to rise.
  * [Nevada]
    * You've allowed Hilary Clinton to win Iowa and Bernie Sanders to win New Hampshire.  Frank's battling for last place with Martin O'Malley, you need to do something BIG.  Blackmail the Attorney General to indict Hilary over her emails or poison Bernie Sander's wife so he has to leave the campaign.  [Blackmail/Poison]
      * [Blackmail]  Success.  Hilary is in prison and now it's down to you and Bernie.  Our budget for Nevada is $5 million.  How much do you want to use buying super delegates? [Specify $ amount]
        [> $1mil]
        [< $1mil]
      * [Poison] Brutal mistake.  Mrs. Sander's bounced back and Bernie is surging off of sympathy points.  Do you want to resign as campaign manager [Yes/No]
        * [Yes] Frank went on to win.  You would have been his Chief of Staff.
        * [No] You've been given more chance and you owe Frank a favor, he now totally owns you.
