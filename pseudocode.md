- What is your name?
  - `Sean`
- Nice to meet you, `Sean`. Congratulations on your new job as a web developer intern.  Your annual salary will be $30,000 per year.  I'm here to help you find a place to live. Now which part of the city would you like to live.**(NW, SW, NE, SE)**
    - `NW`
        -  Northwest has great bars, resturants and tons of night life. You have Champange taste on a beer budget. Unfortunately your intern salary wont cover the $2,000 per month rent. Do you get 3 roommates or uber on nights and weekends. **(R/U)**
            - `R`roommate
                - So you miss your college days, dorm rooms, roommates, and drama. Your first 2 roommates are great and pay there rent on time but the third one loses her job and can't make the rent. Do you kick her out so you can find a new roommate or start make her sleep on the couch and do AirBnB in her old room? **(K/A)**
                    - `K`kick her out
                        - Reasonable choice.  Everyone needs to pay their own way, who cares if you loose your best friend from 5th grade in the process.  As the saying goes, "If you want a friend in DC get a dog!"
                    - `A`AirBnB
                        - AirBnB is a great way to cover your missing rent and help if he couldn't pay rent he should be glad he can sleep on the couch. AirBnB works out well for two weeks until your landlord notices all the traffic in and out the apartment.  You are fined, and evicted for violating your lease.  You are forced to sleep in your car and shower in your office gym.
            - `U` uber
                - Uber is great way to make money on your time with your car.  Uber black pays more but uber x has fewer rules.  Do you decide on uber X or uber black? **(X/B)**
                    - `X`
                        - on uber x you must work 5 hours a day 7 days a week to come up with the rent.  You now have no social life outside of uber and your internship.
                    - `B`
                        - Uber black pays 3 times $40 per hour and you only have to work 15 hours a month to cover your rent.  Uber requires you buy commercial auto insurance which takes an exra $300/ per month so you barely break even.  Hey at least you don't have roommates and can make the rent every month.
    - `SW`
        - Very Resonable choice. In fact it is so reasonable that 50,000 people just like you made the same choice and Southwest becomes the the part of the city with the most rapidly increasing rents.  You decide to sign a 5 year lease to lock-in a rent you can afford.  You better love this internship and stay in DC for a while because with the $5,000 deposit you can't afford to move again any time soon.
    - `NE`
        - Northeast is a wise choice.  Lots of up and coming nieghborhoods and your new place is in walking distance to your internship. You no longer use your car on a regular basis.  Do you sell your car or keep it? **(S/k)**
            - `s`ell
                - You sell your car and use the money to buy a new matching set of apple products, Macbook, Ipad, and Iphone now you can code in style!
            - `k`eep
                - Hey you never know when you might need a car.  You use it for random roadtrips and as a backup when you need to go shopping.  As a bonus it becomes a free billboard to advertise your new tech startup.
    - `SE`
        - Anacostia is one of the last places you can still get a one bedroom for less than $1000 per month.  You find the deal of a life time for $875 per month. The last decision you need to make is which apartment level you want.  Do you want the top floor or the basement? **(T/B)**
            - `T`op
                - Choosing the top floor guarantees no one will be stomping above your head. You can sleep in on the weekends with no interruptions.  The elevator breaks down after 2 weeks and you have to walk up 4 flights to your unit. On the bright side at least you don't have to pay for a gym membership with all those stairs.
            - `B`asement
                - The basement seems like a great choice, its cool in the summer time and easy access for bring things in and out your apartment. Your apartment is broken into and you learn the hard way easy access isn't always good.
